Sw|tch Blayd is a simple game where the main mechanic is the player's current rotating direction. If the player is rotating the same way as 'coins', they'll pick them up, and if they're rotating the same way as obstacles they'll go through them. It's a very simple game but I've had a lot of fun making it. Since the code behind it is relatively simple, I've put a lot of work into making the visuals as appealing as possible and fine tuning the game's performance and small details like adding a plugin to detect if the user has music in the background.Â
